# Personal Portfolio 2023
This is my personal portfolio website for 2023. It is fully responsive and is available in both the light and dark modes. The website is built using Tailwind CSS and some Javascript as well. As for the design, I strived for something simplistic and clean, where my main source of inspiration was Apple's website. Hope you would enjoy browsing through it, and feel free to say hello! ðŸ‘‹
